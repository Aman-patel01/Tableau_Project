# Tableau_Project
This GitHub repository showcases the development of an HR Analytics Dashboard using Tableau, leveraging an Excel dataset. The project focuses on creating an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that provides data-driven insights into various HR metrics and trends.
Key Features:
Excel Dataset: The project utilizes an Excel dataset containing HR-related data, including employee information, performance metrics, attrition rates, and other relevant HR metrics. This dataset serves as the foundation for creating the HR analytics dashboard.
Tableau Dashboard: Using Tableau, the project develops an intuitive and interactive dashboard that presents HR data in a visually appealing manner. The dashboard comprises multiple visualizations, including charts, graphs, and tables, enabling stakeholders to gain insights at a glance.
Key HR Metrics: The dashboard highlights key HR metrics such as employee retention, attrition rates, performance ratings, training effectiveness, and workforce demographics. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the organization's HR performance and allow stakeholders to identify trends and areas for improvement.
Drill-down and Filter Functionality: The dashboard incorporates drill-down and filter functionality, enabling users to explore specific segments of the HR data based on parameters such as department, job role, tenure, or performance level. This feature enhances the user experience and facilitates in-depth analysis.
Data Visualization Techniques: The project employs various data visualization techniques, including bar charts, line graphs, heat maps, and scatter plots, to effectively communicate HR insights. These visualizations aid in identifying patterns, correlations, and outliers within the HR dataset.
Insights and Recommendations: The HR analytics dashboard provides actionable insights and recommendations based on the data analysis. Stakeholders can make informed decisions on areas such as talent management, performance improvement, employee engagement, and workforce planning.
Documentation and Deployment: The repository includes documentation guiding users on how to connect Tableau to the Excel dataset, customize the dashboard, and deploy it in their own environment. This enables easy replication and customization of the HR analytics dashboard for specific organizational needs.
By sharing this project on GitHub, we aim to provide HR professionals, data analysts, and organizations with a valuable resource for HR analytics. The HR analytics dashboard built with Tableau enables data-driven decision-making, empowers stakeholders to identify HR trends and insights, and supports strategic HR planning and improvement initiatives.
